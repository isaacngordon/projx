# Node.js Web Application Template

## Overview

This template provides a basic structure for a Node.js web application. It includes essential files and directories to help you get started quickly.

## Intended Architecture

The architecture of this template follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Represents the user interface and presentation layer.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and interacts with the model.

## Directory Structure

- **app.js**: The main entry point of the application.
- **routes/**: Contains route definitions for the application.
- **public/**: Contains static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **views/**: Contains HTML templates for rendering views.

## Recommended Extensions

To enhance the functionality of your Node.js web application, consider integrating the following extensions for common use cases:

### Setting Up a Database

- **PostgreSQL**
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Install PostgreSQL on your machine or use a cloud provider.
    2. Use the `pg` package to connect your application to the database.
    3. Create a `.env` file to store your database credentials securely.

- **MongoDB**
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Install MongoDB locally or use a service like MongoDB Atlas.
    2. Use the `mongoose` package to define schemas and interact with the database.
    3. Set up your connection string in a configuration file.

### Implementing API Authentication

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Install the `jsonwebtoken` package.
    2. Create a middleware function to verify tokens on protected routes.
    3. Store tokens securely on the client side.

### Implementing Client Authentication

- **OAuth 2.0**
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Choose an OAuth provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
    2. Use the `passport` package for authentication strategies.
    3. Set up routes for login and callback handling.
